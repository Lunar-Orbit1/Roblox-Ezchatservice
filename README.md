This module makes it easier to use the various chat service functions, like adding speakers and chat tags
This can not do everything, but it makes the vast majority of things easier.
If you want a demo, please look at the 'Demo' script
	   
To use the module, you must require it. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Place the folder in ServerScriptService
2. In your script, put the following code in at the top of the script <br>
	`local chatM = require(game.ServerScriptService:WaitForChild("EzChatService").MainModule)`
3. Your good! Now to do something like adding a tag, do the following:<br>
	`chatM:SetChatColor(speaker, Color3.new(1,1,0))`
	   		
If there are any errors, or you are confused, please contact me!
